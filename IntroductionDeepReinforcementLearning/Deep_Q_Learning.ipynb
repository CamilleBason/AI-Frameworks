The basic idea is that by storing an agentâ€™s experiences, and then randomly drawing batches of them to train the network, we can more robustly learn to perform well in the task. The Experience Replay buffer stores a fixed number of recent memories, and as new ones come in, old ones are removed. When the time comes to train, we simply draw a uniform batch of random memories from the buffer, and train our network with them. For our DQN, we will build a simple class that handles storing and retrieving memories."

    "\n",
    "In order to explain the reasoning behind the architecture changes that Dueling DQN makes, we need to first explain some a few additional reinforcement learning terms. The Q-values that we have been discussing so far correspond to how good it is to take a certain action given a certain state. This can be written as Q(s,a). This action given state can actually be decomposed into two more fundamental notions of value. The first is the value function V(s), which says simple how good it is to be in any given state. The second is the advantage function A(a), which tells how much better taking a certain action would be compared to the others. We can then think of Q as being the combination of V and A. More formally:\n",
    "$$Q(s,a) =V(s) + A(a)$$\n",
    "The goal of Dueling DQN is to have a network that separately computes the advantage and value functions, and combines them back into a single Q-function only at the final layer. It may seem somewhat pointless to do this at first glance. Why decompose a function that we will just put back together? The key to realizing the benefit is to appreciate that our reinforcement learning agent may not need to care about both value and advantage at any given time. For example: imagine sitting outside in a park watching the sunset. It is beautiful, and highly rewarding to be sitting there. No action needs to be taken, and it doesnâ€™t really make sense to think of the value of sitting there as being conditioned on anything beyond the environmental state you are in. We can achieve more robust estimates of state value by decoupling it from the necessity of being attached to specific actions."

    "This lead to often overestimates the Q-values of the potential actions to take in a given state. While this would be fine if all actions were always overestimates equally, there was reason to believe this wasnâ€™t the case. You can easily imagine that if certain suboptimal actions regularly were given higher Q-values than optimal actions, the agent would have a hard time ever learning the ideal policy. In order to correct for this, the authors of DDQN paper propose a simple trick: instead of taking the max over Q-values when computing the target-Q value for our training step, we use our primary network to chose an action, and our target network to generate the target Q-value for that action. By decoupling the action choice from the target Q-value generation, we are able to substantially reduce the overestimation, and train faster and more reliably. Below is the new DDQN equation for updating the target value.\n",
